#Advent of Code #3
#Given a 2d 'map' comprised of 'trees' (#) and open space (.), determine how many
# trees will be encountered by traversing the map on a slope of -1/3, starting from top left
#lines 0-7 of input file (aka map):
# .##......#.##..#..#..##....#...
# ...##.....#...###........###...
# #....##....#.....#.....#..##.##
# .......#.###.#......#..#..#..#.
# ##..........#....#.#...#.......
# ###.#.#.#......##...#..........
# .#.##........#..............#..
# ..#..........#...##..#.......##
#
#irl, the map repeats infinitely to the right:
# .##......#.##..#..#..##....#....##......#.##..#..#..##....#... -->
# ...##.....#...###........###......##.....#...###........###... 
# #....##....#.....#.....#..##.###....##....#.....#.....#..##.## 
# .......#.###.#......#..#..#..#........#.###.#......#..#..#..#. -->
# ##..........#....#.#...#.......##..........#....#.#...#....... 
# ###.#.#.#......##...#..........###.#.#.#......##...#..........
# .#.##........#..............#...#.##........#..............#.. -->
# ..#..........#...##..#.......##..#..........#...##..#.......## 

trees = 0

with open('input.txt', 'r') as file:
    for i,line in enumerate(file):
        line = line.strip()
        if line[(i*3) % len(line)] == '#':
            trees += 1



print('Number of trees: ' + str(trees))
